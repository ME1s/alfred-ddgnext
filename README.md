# alfred-ddgnext
This is a workflow for the Alfred, an application launcher for Mac OSX. The workflow allows to perform queries on DuckDuckGo directly from Alfred with Auto Suggestion from DuckDuckGo. 

To start, open Alfred and type as key word "s". You can then start your query. The dropdown menu shows constantly auto suggestion as given by DuckDuckGo.

## Attributions
This workflow was originally created by [Jonathan Poritsky](http://www.candlerblog.com/2014/05/08/duckduckgo-next/) with auto suggestion form Google. With the updated search functionality of DuckDuckGo Next which provides its own auto suggestion this became obsolete. He kindly allowed to continue his work and update the workflow.
