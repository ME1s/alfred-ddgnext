# alfred-ddgnext

This is a workflow for the Alfred, an application launcher for Mac OSX.
Using this workflow, query the DuckDuckGo search engine and get its auto suggestions showing right in your Alfred launcher window.

To start, open Alfred and type as key word "d" (for "DuckDuckGo"). You can then enter your query while the dropdown menu shows constantly auto suggestion as given by DuckDuckGo. Press Enter to search with the chosen query in the browser.


## Configuration

With the new Alfred version 3, variables got introduced. You can now in the workflow set the variable `noscript` to `true` if you prefer to open the DuckDuckGo results with the JavaScript-free website of DuckDuckGo.


## Attributions

This workflow was originally created by [Jonathan Poritsky](http://www.candlerblog.com/2014/05/08/duckduckgo-next/) with auto suggestion form Google. With the updated search functionality of DuckDuckGo Next which provides its own auto suggestion this became obsolete. He kindly allowed to continue his work and update the workflow.
